Department of Computer Science, in JSON format.Please write a function named retrieve_all(), which retrieves the data of all the courses which are currently active 
(the field enabled has the value true).

Each tuple contains the following fields from the original data:
  the name of the course: fullName
  name
  year
  the sum of the values listed in exercises
  
  Each course also has its own URL, where more specific weekly data about the course is available.
