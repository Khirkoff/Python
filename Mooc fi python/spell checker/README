In this exercise you will write an improved version of the Spell checker from the previous part.

Just like in the previous version, the program should ask the user to type in a line of text. Your program should then perform a spell check,and print out feedback to the user, so that all misspelled words have stars around them.
Additionally, the program should print out a list of suggestions for the misspelled words.
