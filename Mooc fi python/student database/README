First write a function named add_student, which adds a new student to the database.

Please write a function named add_course, which adds a completed course to the information of a specific student in the database.

The course data is a tuple consisting of the name of the course and the grade.

Courses with grade 0 should be ignored when adding course information. Additionally, if the course is already in the database in that specific student's information,
the grade recorded in the database should never be lowered if the course is repeated.

Please write a function named summary, which prints out a summary based on all the information stored in the database.
