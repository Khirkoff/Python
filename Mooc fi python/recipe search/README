This exercise is about creating a program which allows the user to search for recipes based on their names, preparation times, or ingredients used. The program should read the recipes from a file submitted by the user.

Each recipe consists of three or more lines. The first line has the name of the recipe, the second line contains an integer number representing the preparation time in minutes, and the remaining line or lines contain the ingredients used, one on each line. The recipe ends with an empty line, with the exception of the final recipe in the file which just ends with the end of the file. So, there can be more than one recipe in a single file, like in the example below.
